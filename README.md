# Title

Mod-18-social-media-dev

## Description

This purpose of this program is to build and structure an API, using MongoDB, Express.js and Mongoose packages, that would allow Users of a network web application, in this case a social media platform, to interact with each other through Thoughts and Reactions to those Thoughts online.

Output is based on the acceptance criteria outlined in the Module 18 Assignment Overview [Module-18-assignment](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/1181/assignments/23378?module_item_id=466035).

An animated example of the expected layout of the blog is included in the Challenge outline.

## Installation

* Using the api routes and controllers that have been set up in the files attached to this application, the application is activated by typing "npm start" in CLI to make the connection to localhost:3001.
  
## Usage

The site enables Users of a specific social media web-application to share various bits of information specific to themselves and each other.  For instance, once a User has been created, that user can then post a thought or thoughts, each of which other Users may express an opnoin by posting a reaction to that specific thought, attaching it to the thought Id.

## Testing

The Insomnia application is used to test the API routes; testing should be able to exhibit the API's creating both Users and Thoughts, the Thoughts being created in association with the User via their ID's.  Testing should also successfully demonstrate the ability to get all Users or Thoughts, as well as get either, update either or delete either by their ID, as well as API's that create and delete a friend or array of friends to a specific User Id as well as create and delete a reaction or array of reactions to a specific Thought Id.

## Credits

* Similar to the Module 14 assignment, the majority of the program coding is based on the module 18 lesson material. Also similar to that assignment, as the challenge and acceptance criteria are very similar to those lessons and a large percentage of the variables and other coding are based on standard practicies and naming conventions, there is a fair amount of duplication of that material in my applicaton.
* Documentation for MongoDB [website](https://www.mongodb.com) and Mongoose [npm page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
* As usual, several visits to Stack Overflow [website](https://stackoverflow.com) provided some finetuning or helped to clarify certain items in the modules.
* TA's during office hours and my tutor in my weekly tutoring session were also key in helping me to get this app working.
